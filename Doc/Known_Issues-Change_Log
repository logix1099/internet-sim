                     inet Known Issues and Change Log
                     ================================


------------>Version 1.0 Released Jan 15 2016<------------------

   ==================
   | #1 Jan 17 2016 |
   ==================

There is an issue with throwing exceptions from within call backs. Where
AnyEvent is concerned, an error message is generated by EV and the
exception is ignored.  

ACTION: Fixed using Exc::TryCatch. Code retrofitted in hubServer.pl,
p2pServer.pl and inet16.

STATUS: Closed 

   ==================
   | #2 Jan 18 2016 |
   ==================

make tidy invokes perltidy to format perl source code files.  perltidy
also checks perl syntax and reports the error

   ## Please see file tb.cew.ERR 

when checking the file tb.cew. This is the case because it thinks cew
constructs are perl syntax errors. This message can be ignored and the
.ERR files can be deleted with make clean.

ACTION: Ignore

STATUS: Closed

   ==================
   | #3 Jan 19 2016 |
   ==================

Cew and vnet.pl use smartmatch. Smartmatch has recently been deprecated.
In future versions of Perl, it may be removed or enhanced. We are
currently using

   This is perl 5, version 20, subversion 2 (v5.20.2) built for
   x86_64-linux-gnu-thread-multi (with 43 registered patches, see perl -V
   for more detail)

and the following disables smartmatch warnings:

   no warnings "experimental::smartmatch";

Note, in future or past versions of Perl, the "no warnings" statement
may itself produce errors or warning.

ACTION: Watch over time

STATUS: Active

   ==================
   | #4 Feb 1  2016 |
   ==================

Underlying TCP sockets are closed by the OS if left inactive for
a prescribed amount of time.  It is difficult to determine
if a socket is functioning without actually receiving data 
from the socket.

A related problem is that the Line module inbuff needs packets
to flush any garbage data that might accumulate once a packet
is dequeued.

ACTION: Modify heartbeat to be a heatbeat packet.  No activity on a
socket is flagged with a warning that the associated virtual interface
is not responding. Since the heartbeat is now a packet, we get Line buffer
flushing for free.

STATUS: Closed

   ==================
   | #5 Feb 2  2016 |
   ==================

Cew reports a problem with Record/Nic.  The method dequeue_packet_fragment
in Record/Nic is missing a parameter.  Consequently, the method always
uses the default length regardless of what is specified in the test case.
In addition, the test case attempts to dequeue a packet fragment of
length 10 and expects to see the packet Peter. The framed packed is
'_G_Peter_H_'  and has length 11.

ACTION: Add the missing parameter and ask dequeue_packet_fragment
in the test case to dequeue 11 characters rather than 10.

STATUS: Closed


   ==================
   | #6 Feb 2  2016 |
   ==================

Race condition detected in hubServer and p2pServer

ACTION: Debugged

STATUS: Closed
