Test Plan for LIFO.pm (stack)
Peter Walsh Jan 2014

assumptions max_size >2

test environment
   cew driver
   no stubs

test case selection strategy
  special values
     instance state
        interval rule on size of stack: [0..max_size]
        (ie empty, half-full and full)
     method parameters
        none
   test cases
      for each of the special instance state values,
         call push, pop and top
         check exception behavior
         after set calls, check get call values
    test implementation strategy
       load (n) pre-loads the stack
       eg load (3) loads stack with 10 20 and 30
       statement coverage measured using cover.
