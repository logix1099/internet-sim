gen.pl generates Makefiles for all the modules in inet with the exception
of the main Makefile and the Cew module (which has no Makefile).  Warning,
it overwrites existing makefiles. Also, note that if tb.cew does not exist
in a directory, the template tb.cew is copied from Cew/Template. This
tb.cew is only a stub and has no test cases and no errors :)
