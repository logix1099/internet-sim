Test Plan for Exception.pm
Peter Walsh Oct 2012

Test the constructor and methods.

In addition, the script contains test cases that are expected to fail.
The intent is to verify that cew checks the presence and absence of
exceptions in the appropriate way.

Make bats is expected to produce:

Test Case ERROR (Ncase) in script at line number 45
Unexpected Exception full thrown 
Test Case ERROR (Ecase) in script at line number 51
Unexpected exception ull thrown 
Test Case ERROR (Ecase) in script at line number 52
Unexpected exception full thrown 
Test Case ERROR (Ecase) in script at line number 55
Expected exception full not thrown 

**********Summary**********
Total number of test cases = 8
Total number of test cases in error = 4
